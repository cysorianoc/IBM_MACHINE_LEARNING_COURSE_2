# IBM_MACHINE_LEARNING_COURSE_2

## Course Overview
Welcome to the course, Supervised Machine Learning: Regression

This course is your gateway to mastering the foundational concepts and practical skills of supervised machine learning, with a primary focus on linear regression. Whether you're pursuing a career in data science, analytics, or machine learning, this course will equip you with the tools and understanding to confidently build and evaluate predictive models.

You will explore how supervised learning models make predictions based on data and gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets. The course is structured into six modules, each building on the previous, leading to a final project that challenges you to apply what you’ve learned to a dataset of your choice.

## Course outline
This course has 6 modules, listed below. We encourage you to set aside several hours each week to successfully complete all modules in 6 weeks. Consistency will best help you achieve your learning goals!

You will benefit most from viewing all the videos and readings,  and  solidifying that knowledge by completing all the hands-on labs and the final culminating project.

### Module 1: Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning and Linear Regression

In this module, you’ll identify the three primary types of machine learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement. Explore real-world applications across various industries and distinguish between prediction and interpretation tasks. Examine the fundamentals of linear regression, including key assumptions and use cases. You’ll learn how to measure model error, improve predictive accuracy, and use practical tools to train and evaluate linear regression models.

### Module 2: Data Splits and Polynomial Regression

In this module, understand the importance of training/testing splits for reliable model evaluation. You’ll learn how to use the train_test_split() function to properly partition your dataset and explore how model complexity influences prediction error. You’ll also apply polynomial regression techniques to capture non-linear relationships within data.

### Module 3: Cross-Validation Techniques

In this module, discover how cross-validation enhances model reliability and fairness. You’ll learn to use k-fold and other cross-validation methods to reduce bias and variance. You’ll examine how to balance training data size with validation accuracy. You’ll evaluate your model’s generalizability across different data subsets for better performance insights.

### Module 4: Bias-Variance Tradeoff and Regularization

In this module, you’ll grasp the core concept of the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning model performance. You’ll explore how regularization techniques, such as Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net, can help mitigate overfitting. You’ll compare the strengths and trade-offs of different regularization methods and also practice applying regularization strategies in real-world modeling scenarios.

### Module 5: The Loss Function and Model Optimization

In this module, you’ll understand how loss functions are used to quantify prediction error in machine learning. You’ll explore how optimization algorithms work to minimize loss and enhance model performance. You’ll connect key mathematical concepts to hands-on model tuning workflows and gain insight into how learning algorithms adjust and improve based on data.

### Module 6: Final Project – Regression Analysis and Insights

In this final project, you’ll select a real-world dataset and apply comprehensive regression techniques from start to finish. You'll begin by cleaning and preparing the data, then build and refine predictive models to uncover meaningful patterns. Emphasis will be placed on evaluating model performance, interpreting results, and deriving actionable insights, prioritizing clarity and impact over technical implementation. You’ll present your work through a well-structured report that clearly communicates your methodology, analysis, and conclusions. To support your development, your submission will be assessed using an AI-powered grading system that provides automated feedback on clarity, organization, and the depth of your insights.
